To view any page give the address of the controller in the url
For example to load fordogs we need to give address as follows:
http://localhost/petdoctor/web/controllers/ForDogs.php

Every view has a corressponding controller
view file name is in small letters and is stored in view folder = fordogs.php
controller file name has first letter captial of each word and is stored in controllers = forcats.php

We are using controller to do tasks such as getting data from database or performing some business logic before we load any page

To import database:
1. Go to php my admin
2. Got to import tab
3. Click on choose file and then click on "Go"

The db file name is pet_doctor.sql and is stored in /petdoctor/web folder
